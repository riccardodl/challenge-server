# challenge-server

This small proof of concept runs a small ASP.NET server that use Azure's ML services to classify ropes.
Ropes are distinguished in "good" or "bad" ropes.
cshtml pages provide the frontend components for CRUD operations.

The basic idea of the challenge is to create a service that allows an hypotetical insurance operator to manage assets on board of ships.
